This is a basketball simulator. 
It takes two teams and plays to a score of 100 (this can be modified). 
When completed it displays a simple box score.
Teams and players are pre-set but names and attributes can be edited. 
We can now scrape player statistics using BeautifulSoup4 and have the stats determine the player attributes.

The next direction is to modify and correctly weight the game engine to take into account these statistics.
