This is the first iteration of my basketball simulator. I learned a lot in this process.

It takes two teams and plays to a score of 100.
Teams and players are pre-set but names and attributes can be edited. 
When completed it displays a simple box score as well as play-by-play data.

The code is definitely not perfect, nor is the output pretty but it all works as intended and it achieved what I wanted.

Upon succesfully scraping and collating stats for the 2020-21 season it has become obvious that the game engine will need to be re-written to effectively translate these statistics into accurate results. At this point I will leave the development of this project here and be back with an improved basketball sim V1.
